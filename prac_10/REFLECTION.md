Regarding the estimates for the practical tasks they were either slightly overestimated how long it would take
(such as estimating 15 minutes for a 10-minute project) or vastly underestimated (such as 2 hours for an hour-long project).
These aggregated to approximately on the estimation as there were more of the former however the accuracy was not good enough. 
This was improved over the course of the semester however and the only time it went majorly different was when
there was an error in the code that took a while to fix. 

Regarding code reviews of someone else doing my code I have learned better ways to format my code along with better coding
practices. While reviewing somebody else's code this has improved my ability to better error check and review my own code 
before I am comfortable in saying it is complete. 

Regarding the practical tasks I think they were overall done really well for the subject. The only potential changes I can
think of is a time suggestion (e.g. 1-4 hours or 3-8 hours) that is broad as to not impact faster or slower coders but 
just as a reference point. Also, I believe that having the deliverables at the start of the README.md file is good as this
can achieve what my previous suggestion suggests with greater accuracy, and it ensures that all students know what is 
required prior to the commencement of the project. 


I think my two best code reviews were definitely my first two.
